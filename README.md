# Gamedev-Secretary-Recruitment-task1-
This is repository for the first task provided for the Secretary recruitment in which we had to make our own game using unity. 
1) My contributions: I have mainly focussed on programming this game and establishing a basic game loop. Apart from this, the background music was also made by me. Most of the other assets used are from unity asset store which were free to download.
2) The controls are pretty standard, we use W and S to move up and down or we can also use the up and down arrows to do so. The left click of the mouse will allow you to shoot bullets. The objective is to score as much as possible before the planet health runs out or you colllide with the enemy warship . The controls are described in the instructions menu of the game as well.
3) There is a score bar and a Health bar added to the game. If any enemy ship flys past you, the planet's health detoriates. There is a point for each enemy ship destroyed.
